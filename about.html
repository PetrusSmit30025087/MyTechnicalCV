                    Computers has been a part of my life since I can remember. Information technology was the obvious career path for me because I love computers and everything about them. I began programming when I went to grade 10 in highschool and chose IT as a subject. I am now busy studying my Bsc IT degree at the North-West University. I love the feeling of creating something with code, sometimes a program will run from the start without problems but its much more satisfying when you finally figure out what the problem is and learn out of it

                <p class="futurep">
                    After my bsc degree I want to study my honours degree too. After which I will be ready to begin my career as a system analyst, software developer or anything that comes onto my path. My dream is to travel the world and experience as much as I can in my lifetime
